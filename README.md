## 🔥 Firebase Setup (Optional)

This app is ready for Firebase integration 🔥  
To use Firebase services (like login, Firestore, etc.):

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project and register your Android/iOS app
3. Download the config files:
   - `google-services.json` → `android/app/`
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` → `ios/Runner/`
4. Add Firebase initialization:
```dart
await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);

⚠️ firebase_options.dart is not included for security.
📩 DM your email after setting up Firebase — I’ll personally send you the pubspec.yaml file with all dependencies pre-configured.
